# People's views

Due to differences in the timing and extent of infection in different countries, as well as the use of mainstream social medias in some countries, we need to distinguish between the location of the authors and obtain data from different software. For example, most Western countries use Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram as their main social platforms, while China uses Weibo as the main social platform.

So, based on our goal, we need to collect data separately by country. The data we need from social platforms are people’s views, post time, and geographical locations. We can find people’s views about COVID-19 by searching for tags on social platforms, such as “COVID-19”, “economy”, “unemployment rate”, etc., and use web scraping to get the content of the views, the time of post, and posters’ location from profile page if possible. Word embedding could help us to find location information from the content, because it breaks down the whole views into individual words, which can help us identify whether the word is in the geographic information we are looking for, as long as we set the geographic information in advance. If the content does not contain the geographic information we need, we could consider using the location from poster's profile.
