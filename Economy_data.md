# Economy Data
- The national economy can be evaluated from different aspects. Under the certain context of Covid-19 we want to put more focus on the indexes like employment-to-population ratio. Except for the employment rate, some other indexes can also be taken into account such as GDP(Gross 
Domestic Product), CCI(Consumer Confidence Index) and CPI(Consumer Price Index). These data can be obtained from the government report as well as the employment report.   
- Because of the uncertainty of time span, we may encounter situations where the indexes go through different calendar years. Some data may have the indexes seperated by quarter or months, if not we need to select the time span in order to make the indexes paralleled with the data collected from public opinion part.  .
- When all the necessary data has been obtained, we may start to do some pre-processing of the data, we need to apply standardization approach in order to make sure the data is of the same scale.
- To clearly identify the trend of public opinion and national economy, we can use line chart to demonstrate the trend in a vivid way. Comparisons may then be made to identify whether public opinion and national economy have correlation or not.
