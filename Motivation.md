## Motivation

The economy goes through peaks and recessions. More specifically, there are four stages of the economy, namely, expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. One indicator of where we are in the economic cycle is the saving level. Saving level is strongly influenced by people's willingness to invest and consume. 

How to quantitatively measure the willingness? One possible way is to conduct sentiment analysis of comments on the future economic outlook. If the overall opinion towards the future economy is negative, theoretically people will be more inclined to saving instead of consuming.

Therefore, our analysis aims to exploit the connection between people's opinion on the future economic outlook and the real economic cycle.

A possible application of this study is that it can assist policymakers in predicting when the economic recession will end.

For example, Covid-19 has led many countries into the highest unemployment rate in centuries. Many, therefore, predict that there will be a fast increase in consumption after lockdown being released. However, there is no solid evidence to support it. Sentiment analysis can provide such proof. If society expects the recession to end and those unemployed can find occupation soon enough, they will tend to consume more as compensation for having to stay inside for such a long time.
